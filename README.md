# stress-modelling
Codes written by Hamish Hirschberg 2016
The codes were written as part of a Master's project at Victoria University of Wellington.
They follow the method of Flesch et al. (2001) to model the stress.
They require as input a velocity model and a gravitational potential energy per unit volume (GPE) file.
